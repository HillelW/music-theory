    "## Pitches as Abstractions from Wave Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "A musical instrument generates periodic waves in the medium in which it is embedded. Suppose two instruments such as a piano and guitar play what is commonly regarded as \"the same note\". Inspection of the two resulting wave forms in this case reveals that the two wave forms are *not* identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this example, we can see that the notion of pitch is an *equivalence relation* over the set of wave forms. Two wave forms are considered equivalent and said to have *the same pitch* if they strike the listener as qualitatively being \"the same note\". This equivalence relation partitions the set of wave forms into disjoint equivalence classes. Each wave form belongs to just one pitch equivalence class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard keyboard ranges from 4 octaves below A4 (tunded to 440 HZ), to 4 octaves above middle C (C4), for a total of 88 individual pitches based on the equal-tempered scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pitch that lies 4 octaves below A4 is called \"A0\" and the pitch that lies 4 octaves above A4 is called \"C8\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all pitches on the keyboard is called *chromatic pitch-space* and corresponds to the set:\n",
    "\n",
    "{A0, ..., C8}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above is a *set of sets*, since each element of the above set is itself an equivalence class of pitches. For example, an A0 can be played on a guitar, flute, violin, etc. even though the timbre of each instrument is associated with a distinct wave form.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tones as Abstractions from Pitches\n",
    "\n",
    "Any two pitches separated by either 0 or 12 chromatic steps (an octave) are considered equivalent (not necessarily equal). If we view this relation as a set of ordered pairs of the form (pitch_1, pitch_2), then this relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Such a relation is called an equivalence relation. This equivalence relation partitions the set of pitches in pitch-space into disjoint pitch classes<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2) in the same way that the integers can be partitioned into disjoint equivalence classes by imposing an equivalence relation modulo 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pitch class is the set of all pitches which are equivalent under the octave equivalence relation. Because there are only 12 pitch classes, we can label them using the integers from 0 to 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 = {C0, C1, ... C8},\n",
    "2 = {D0, D1, ... D8},\n",
    "...\n",
    "11 = {B0, B1, ... B8}.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can concisely represent the set of all pitch classes as:\n",
    "\n",
    "{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above set corresponds to chromatic pitch-class space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep the distinction between pitch-space and pitch-class space clear since the two spaces have different properties, such as how to compute the distance between any two elements in a given space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch-class space is properly understood as a set of sets since each element of the set is itself a set of equivalent pitches. However, when performing computations, we can usually pretend as if pitch-class space is just a set of 12 numbers without any loss of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of pitch-class space are often called tones. The elements of pitch space are usually called pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of pitch classes is indepdendent of any particular tuning. For example, the element 0 could theoretically represent the set of all C pitches, D pitches, etc. However, we will obey the arbitrary convention of associating 0 with all of the C pitches on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these ideas in Python, we begin with an ordered pair of the form (S, ~), where S is any set, and ~ is an equivalence relation on thet set S. Such an ordered pair is called a *setoid*.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a setoid, we can apply the equivalence relation ~ to the set S to obtain the set of equivalence classes obtained by using ~ to partition the set S into disjoint sets.\n",
